  <title>Using Tracker Capture</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Tracker capture is an advanced version of the event capture app. While the event capture
      deals with single event without registration, tracker capture deals with multiple events
      (including single event) with registration. The implication of this is that, any event
      capturing has to be for a registered tracked entity instance (TEI). This makes
      registration/searching of TEI a key component of the tracker capture app. </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>TEI search and registration</title>
    <para>To proceed with the tracker capture one needs to have a TEI. As shown in the screenshot
      below, the first page of the app provides two features for this - searching an existing one or
      registering a new one.</para>
    <para/>
    <screenshot>
      <title>Example: searching/registration</title>

    </screenshot>
    <para>All searching and registration operations are accessible from the screen shown above.<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Searching: there are two modes of searching - simple and advanced. The simple one
            works by typing a free text on the provided area. What is typed in the input box is
            applied across all attributes for partial match. The advanced one, which is accessible
            when the small drop-down button is clicked - works when various search criteria are
            provided in the drop down window. Here, the match is exact match. Both search modes
            return matching list of TEI displayed in a table. </para>
          <para>If a program is selected, the app provides further filtering on the table based on
            enrollment status which are All, Active, Completed, Cancelled.  as shown below.</para>
          <screenshot>
            <title>Enrollment status filtering icons</title>
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="resources/images/tracker_capture/enrollment_status.png" format="PNG" align="center" width="20%"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
          <para>The advanced search also provides one more additional feature. Under normal
            circumstances, advanced search is conducted for the selected orgunit (from left-hand
            side tree) and scope (which could be Selected, Immediate children or All children).  The
            left-hand side tree is generated based on the logged in user's assigned orgunits.
            However, there could be cases to search for a TEI from another orgunit (which is not
            neccessarily part of the assigned orgunits. To support such use case, advanced search
            provides another orgunit tree. The tree displayed here depends on the role that the
            logged in user has. If the user has role "Search Tracked Entity Instance in All Org
            Units" or "ALL", a tree with all available orgunits is provided other wise the tree
            displayed in advanced search is the same as the one on the left-hand side. Whichever
            tree (or hierarchy of orgunits) is provided, if an orgunit is selected in advanced
            search, the searching is conducted against this selected orgunit and scope.</para>
          <para>If a program is selected, advanced search allows you to search on the incident date
            if the program has one.</para>
          
          <para>While in the TEI table, clicking on any row takes to the selected TEI's
            dashboard.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Registration: this is accessible through the "Register" button. During registration,
            it is possible to stay on the same page and keep doing more registration or go straight
            to the dashboard of the registered TEI. Selecting a program and doing registration also
            performs enrollment at the background. If a TEI is registered without a program, then
            enrollment is possible from the TEI dashboard. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during registration.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>
    <para/>
    <para>Both search and registration are dictated by a selected program. It is program attributes
      which are being used as search criteria, registration attributes and also as columns names for
      tracked entity list. If no program is selected, the system picks default attributes. If no
      search criteria is assigned for an attribute, then the attribute has no effect on searching.
      However to control the appearance or not of an attribute as a column list, one has to go
      through a menu available under the small gear icon. </para>
    <para>Once a TEI is obtained - either through searching or registration - the app presents the
      selected TEI's dashboard.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tracker dashboard</title>
    <para>All operations on a tracked entity are available from this dashboard. Anticipating
      multiple usecases or operations on registered TEI, we have structured the dashboard as a
      collection of widgets - more widgets can be added. This helps to scale and handle complexity
      while staying simple and clean. </para>

          <imagedata fileref="resources/images/tracker_capture/tei_dashboard.png" format="PNG" align="center" width="90%"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para>As shown in the figure above, the dashboard starts with four sets of menus at the top: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>back button - this helps to go back to the search and registration page</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>previous and next buttons - these are buttons to acces the previous/next TEI
            details</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>program selection menu - this is to dictate what kind of data to record and track
            for the selected TEI. This also affects the contents of the widgets.</para>
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>a small pin icon at the right corner - this allows to pin (or stick) the right side of
            the widgets. This is useful especially during data entry. If for example there are a
            many data elements or big form to fill, sticking the right side helps to remain visible
            while scrolling data entry part.</para>
      </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>a small gear icon at the right corner - currently three functionalities are
            available from this icon.

            </screenshot>            
            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para> Show/hide widgets - this helps to control which widgets to display. From the
                  figure above, there are eight widgets on display. The widgets are collapsible,
                  responsive and draggable - this helps to acquire optimal view area as per user
                  needs. Widget (re)arrangments are saved automatically per user per program.
                </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>Save dashboard layout as default - widgets arrangement is saved automatically
                  everytime a widget's position or state (expand/collapse) is changed. However, for
                  the entrie layout to be considered a default layout for the selected program it is
                  required to explicitly save as "Default layout". </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>Set tei to active/inactive - this has nothing to do with widgets or the
                  dashboard but it helps to set the status of dashborad owner (the TEI) to either
                  active or inactive. If a TEI is set to inactive, only read operations are allowed
                  - no data entry, no profile editing, no enrollment.</para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para> The widgets:- <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Enrollment</emphasis> - this helps to enroll the TEI for the
            selected program. If an active enrollment already exists, the widget automatically
            displays it with some details about it. The widget also helps to do some operations on
            the selected enrollment - for example terminate/complete or a possibility to mark the
            enrollment for followup. The later one helps for example to deal with high-risk cases
            during pregnancy followup. A link to history is also provided if the TEI has historical
            enrollment.</para>
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Indicators</emphasis> - any indicator defined for the selected
            program will have its value cacluated and displayed under this widget. </para>
      </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Dataentry</emphasis> - this is for doing data entry using
            either default or custom forms. Depending on program definition, in particular program
            stages, events will be displayed in a timely fashion. Clicking on any of them displays
            the corresponding data entry. If a stage needs new event, a plus icon is displayed for
            new event creation. To proceed with data entry, it is mandatory to have event date. Once
            an event date is specified it is not possible to change due date. The assumption is that
            by specifying event date, the event has already taken place. If the event hasn't
            occurred yet, it is possible to change due date - this is effectively doing nothing but
            rescheduling. The buttons at the bottom help to change the status of a selected event.
            Another key feature from this widget is addition of multiple notes for an event.
            Normally data recording is through datalements, however there are cases where it is
            necessary to record additional information or comments. This is where the notes section
            comes handy. However, a interesting feature here is - it is not possible to delete a
            note. The idea is notes are more like log books. Both skip-logic and validation
            error/warning messages are supported during data entry.</para>
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Notes | Messaging</emphasis> - this is the same as event notes.
            The difference between the two is that, here notes are attached not to events but to
            enrollments. This helps to record some notes based on enrollment - for example why is an
            enrollment terminated or what is the overall observation of the TEI throughout the
            enrollment. In addition, if the tracked entity has registered a phone number, messaging
            will be available here. With messaging, you can send SMS to the phone number
            registered.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Report</emphasis> - this is to provide a "journal" of the TEI
            per program. A report row is provided for each program the TEI is/was associated.</para>
      </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Profile </emphasis> - this is to edit TEI's profile or
            attributes. Here, if the TEI has an attribute of value type "Tracker Associate", a small
            icon next to the input filed is displayed. Clcking the icon opens a popup where users
            are allowed to either search or register new associate.</para>
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Active programs</emphasis> - this is an extension of the
            enrollment widget. While the enrollment widget displays both active and historical
            enrollment for the selected program, active programs widget displayes all other programs
            that the selected TEI has active enrollments.</para>
      </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Relationship </emphasis> - this helps to relate the selected
            TEI (the one whose dashboard is shown) to another TEI. Adding a relative is possible by
            either searching from existing or registering a new one. If a program is selected while
            registering a new one, the new one will be automatically enrolled to the selected
            program. Another interesting feature in the relationship widget is attribute
            inheritance. For example take Mother-Child relationship and assume there are two
            programs Antenatal care for the mother and Immunization for the child. If among others
            first name, last name and address attributes are required for both programs, it is
            possible to configure last name and address attributes as inheritable. Then during child
            registration, there is no need to refill these inheritable attributes - they can be
            automatically populated based on the mother's value. If for some reason a different
            value is required for the child, it is possible to override.</para>

    <para>Tracker capture app also provides some basic reports. These reports are accessible by
      clicking on the "Reports" link on the left-hand side. Below is a description for some of the
      reports.</para>

    <para>Running any of these repots is very easy, one just has to select a program, orgnisation
      unit scope and whenever possible start and end dates. Below is a sample program summary
      report. It displays a list of TEI's and their records for "MNCH/PNC (Adult Woman)" program.
      The records are organized in the form of tabs where each tab is a program stage. The columns
      in the table are data elements which are configured to be displayed in reports under program
      stage definition.</para>
