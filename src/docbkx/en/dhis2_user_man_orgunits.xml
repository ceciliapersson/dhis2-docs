    <title>The organisational hierarchy</title>
    <para>The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation structure of the DHIS2 instance, such as how  the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas are arranged with respect to each other. It is essentially the &quot;where&quot; dimension of DHIS2, similar to how periods represent the &quot;when&quot; or time dimension. DHIS2 is structured so that the organisational unit hierarchy is a geographical hierarchy, and the GIS module depends on this. Non-geographical hierarchies are discouraged, and would better to be represented through the use of organisational unit groups. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health or a country) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in DHIS2. </para>
    <para>The design of this hierarchy will determine the  geographical units of analysis available to the users  as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. </para>
    <para>Additional  hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative boundaries to the health care sector) can be modeled using organisational groups and group sets, but the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. </para>
    <para>The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations. For instance a country  might have eight provinces, and each province again  might have a number of districts as their children. Normally the health facilities (from which data is typically collected)  will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </para>
    <para>Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g.  splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. </para>
    <important>
      <para>Because the most recent information which is contained in the organisational unit hierarchy is always used for aggregation, it is important to keep in mind that changes to it (such as the division of districts into two separate districts) will not be respected over time. As an example, District A may be sub-divided into District B and District C. This is a process which often happens for political reasons. Facilities which belong to District A would need to be reassigned to District B and C. However, any historical data, which was entered before the split actually occurred, would still be registered as belonging to District B and C and not the defunct District A. This temporal representation of the organisational hierarchy across time will be lost. </para>

      <title>Organisation units</title>
      <para>This is where you can create organisation units (from now on referred to as orgunits) and build up the orgunit hierarchy. Orgunits are added one by one as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current organisational hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in the main list of orgunits in the middle of the screen. When an orgunit is selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate an orgunit in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the orgunit name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To add a new orgunit first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in the top right corner of the list of orgunits. To add a new root orgunit make sure no orgunit is selected in the menu and click on &quot;Add new&quot;. The details of adding a new orgunit are explained in <link linkend="editOrganisationalUnits"/>. </para>
      <section xml:id="ou_edit">
        <title xml:id="editOrganisationalUnits">Editing organisation units</title>
        <para>To edit the properties of an existing orgunit first select its parent (if any) in the left side menu, then locate the orgunit in the listed orgunits, and  click on  the  name of the orgunit that you want to modify. A context menu will appear, and you should select &quot;Edit&quot;. Refer to the screen-shot below to see how it works. </para>

        <para>   The following properties can be defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Name: Define the precise name of the orgunit in this field. Each orgunit must have a unique name. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Short name: Typically, an abbreviation of the full name. This attribute is often used in reports to display the name of the orgunit, where there is limited space available. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Code: In many countries, orgunits are assigned a code. This code can be entered in this field. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Description: A description can be a longer piece of text which can be used to describe the organisationunit. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Opening date: Used to control which orgunits that where existing  at a point in time, e.g. when analysing historical data. This attribute is required. The default date for opening of organisation units is 1900-01-01, but can be set to any date (even dates which occur in the future).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Registers data: This property is used to identify which orgunits that can register data or not. Sometimes administrative orgunits at higher levels in the hierarchy are not supposed to register any data. This can help control the data entry process as only orgunits with this property set to Yes will be available for data entry.  </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Comment: Any additional information that you would like to add can be put here. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Coordinates: This field is used to create the maps in the GIS module. Paste in the coordinates of the orgunit in this field, either a polygon (for orgunits that represent an administrative boundary) or a point (for health facilities). Without this information the GIS module will not work. It might be more efficient to import these coordinates later as a batch job for all orgunits using the import module. See the GIS chapter for more details.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>URL: You can use this field to insert a URL link to an external web site that has additional information about this specific orgunit.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Contact information: A contact person, address, email, and phone number can be entered in these fields. This information can be vital for facilitating follow-up.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Datasets: Datasets can be assigned to organisational units here. See the chapter on &quot;Data sets&quot; for more detailed information on assigning datasets to organisational units. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Organisation unit groups: Assignments to organisational units group sets can be assigned through the individual drop-down boxes which appear for each group set.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>In addition to all of the options listed above, if you have added any attributes to organisation units, your custom attributes may also appear there. Please refer to the section on &quot;Attributes&quot; for more information about how attributes can be used.</para>

    <section xml:id="ou_groupsets">
      <title xml:id="orgunitGroupSets">Organisation unit group sets</title>
      <para>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to orgunits. Any number of group sets can be added, but as a default start all databases will have the two group sets &quot;Type&quot; and &quot;Ownership&quot;. Using these  group sets will simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel PivotTables.</para>
      <para>While a group set like &quot;Type&quot; describes a measure dimension, the actual
        categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an orgunit through the
        orgunit&apos;s group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel hierarchy of orgunits
        with the group set as the root (&quot;Type&quot;), the groups at level 2 (e.g.
        &quot;Clinic&quot;, &quot;Hospital&quot;, &quot;Dispensary&quot;), and the actual orgunits
        at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information and dimensionality to
        the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated by groups within a
        group set. </para>
      <para>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary. A group set is always exclusive, which means that an orgunit cannot be member of more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new organisational unit, you will only be allowed to select a single organisational group membership for each group set. Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means that ALL orgunits must be member of a group in that group set. </para>
      <para>We recommend that you approach the orgunit grouping in the following sequence (and one group set at a time):</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Define a new group set, such as &quot;Location&quot;. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Add new  groups  (such as &quot;Urban&quot;, &quot;Rural&quot; and &quot;Peri-urban&quot;). Once all groups have been defined, return to the organisational unit group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the orgunits that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple organisation units at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the same organisational units in two groups which itself is a member of an organisation unit group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have organisation unit groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A better way to ensure that you do not mistakenly assign an organisation unit to
            multiple members of a group set is you can use the edit feature of each organisational
            unit to assign memberships to each group set. You will only be able to assign a single
            organisation unit at a time however.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>It is important to keep in mind when using the &quot;Organisational unit group&quot; set function, that unless great care is taken, organisational units can be assigned to multiple groups of a group set. This can be checked through the &quot;Data Integrity&quot; module, which will report which organisational units are not members of a compulsory organisational unit group set, and which organisational units have been assigned to more than one member of a group set. </para>
      <section xml:id="ou_groupsets_edit">
        <title xml:id="editOrgunitGroupSets">Editing organisation unit group sets</title>
        <para>Click on the name of the organisation unit group set you wish to modify, followed by &quot;Edit&quot; from the context menu which will appear.  The following properties can be defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Compulsory: Indicate whether ALL orgunits need to be member of a group in this group set or not.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Available groups/Selected groups: Here you assign groups to your group set by using the arrow buttons to move  highlighted groups between the two lists (/selected). If no groups appear in the  list then you must go to orgunit groups and create new groups there first. Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an orgunit that again is already member of a group that has already  been selected by this group set, will not be possible since one orgunit will end up with two group memberships in the same group set. To avoid such situations we recommend first adding groups to group sets, and then orgunits to groups.</para>
