    <title>What training is needed</title>
    <para>In a large system like a country health information system, there will be different roles for different people. The different tasks usually depends on two factors; what the person will be doing, i.e. mainly collect data, or analyse it, or maintain the database, and where the person is located, like a facility, a district office, or at national level. A first task will then be to define the different users. The most common tasks will be:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Data entry</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data analysis processing, preparing reports and other information products</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Database maintenance - managing changes to the database</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Data entry is typically decentralized to lower levels, such as a district. Data processing takes place at all levels, while database maintenance usually is centralized. The following table gives an example of user groups and what tasks they typically have:</para>
    <para>Note here that many of the tasks are not directly linked to the use of DHIS2. Data analysis, data quality assessment, preparing feedback and planning regular review meetings are all integral to the functioning of the system, and should also be covered in a training strategy.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Strategies for training</title>
    <para>To cover the wide array of tasks/users listed above, a training strategy is helpful. The majority of users will be at lower level; entering and using data. Only a few will have to know the database in-depth, usually at national level. The following are useful tips for end-user training strategies.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Training of trainers</title>
      <para>Since the number of units and staff increase exponentially for each level (a country may have many provinces, each with many districts, each with many facilities), training of trainers is the first step. The number of trainers will vary, depending on the speed of implementation envisioned. As described below, both workshops and on-site training are useful, and especially for the on-site training many people will be needed.</para>
      <para>The trainers should be at least at the level of advanced users, in addition knowing how the database is designed, how to install and troubleshoot DHIS2, and some issues of epidemiology, i.e. concepts that are useful for monitoring and evaluation of health services. As the capabilities of the staff increase, the trainers would also need to increase their skills.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Workshops and on-site training</title>
      <para>Experience has showed that training both in workshops/training sessions, and on-site in real work situations are complementary. Workshops are better for training many at the same time, and are useful early on in the training sessions. Preferably the same type of users should be trained.</para>
      <para>On-site training takes place at the work-place of the staff. It is useful to have done more organized training session like in a workshop before, so that on-site training can focus on special issues the individual staff would need more training on. Training on-site will involve less people, so it will be possible to include different types of users. An example would be a district training, where the district information officers and the district medical officer can be trained together. The communication between different users is important in the sense that it forms a common understanding of what is needed, and what is possible. Training can typically be centred around local requirements such as producing outputs (reports, charts, maps) that would be useful for local decision-support.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Continuation of training</title>
      <para>Training is not a one off thing. A multi-level training strategy would aim at providing regular training as the skills of the staff increase. For example, a workshop on data entry and validation should be followed by another workshop on report generation and data analysis some time later. Regular training should also be offered to new staff, and when large changes are made to the system, such as redesign of all data collection forms.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Material and courses</title>
    <para>There is comprehensive material available for training and courses. The main source will be the three manuals available from the DHIS2 documentation repository, to be found at <link xl:href="http://dhis2.org/documentation">here</link>.</para>
    <para>The user documentation covers the background and purpose of DHIS2 together with instructions and explanations of how to perform data entry, system maintenance, meta-data set-up, import and export of data, aggregation, reporting and other topics related to the usage of the software. The developer documentation covers the technical architecture, the design of each module and use of the development frameworks behind DHIS2. The implementation guide is targeted at implementers and super-users and addresses subjects such as system design, database development, data harmonization, analysis, deployment, human resources needed and integration with other systems. The end user manual is a light-weight version of the user documentation meant for end users such as district records officers and data entry clerks. All can be opened/downloaded as both PDF and HTML, and are updated daily with the latest input from DHIS2 users worldwide.</para>
    <para>
The development of these guides depend on input from all users. For information how to to add content to them, please see the appendix on documentation in the User Documentation. Here you will also find information about how to make localized documentation, including versioning in different languages.</para>
    <para>From 2011, regional workshops and courses will be held at least once a year by the international DHIS2 community. The goal is to have national technical teams working with DHIS2 customization and implementation. Sessions will also include training and capacity building by these teams in-country. End-user training, i.e. training of district M&amp;E officers, should take place in each county by these teams.</para>
