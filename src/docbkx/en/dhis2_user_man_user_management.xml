  <title>User management</title>
  <para>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</para>
  <section xml:id="creating_new_users">
    <title>Creating new users and roles</title>
    <para>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose <emphasis role="italic">Users</emphasis> from the &quot;Apps&quot; menu and then click &quot;User&quot; from the menu items on the left-hand pane.</para>

      <para>As part of creating a user name you are required to define the user
      role. Do so by clicking on <emphasis role="italic">User Role</emphasis> on the left side of
      the displayed screen. This will lead you to the User role management page where you can
      click on <guibutton>Add new</guibutton> to create a new role.</para>

      three options namely Datasets, Reports and Authorities user can select
      multiple options from the scroll down menu provided against each field.

      one-by-one.</para>
      <para>In order for particular users to be able to enter data, you must

          <para>Users must be assigned to at least one data capture and maintenance organisation unit. Users will
            have access to all children of the organisation units which have been assigned to
            them. For instance, if a user has been assigned to a district which has several
            facilities contained in the district, the user would have access to the district&apos;s data,
            as well as all of the facilities contained within the district. The data approval organisation
            units control for which organisation units the user can do data entry.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Users can be assigned to any number of data view organisation units. This controls
            which organisation units the user can view aggregated data for in analysis modules.</para>
          <important>
            <para>         Giving access to an organisation unit implicitly gives access to all organisation unit
            below it in the organisation unit hierarchy. Thus, you should not select the descendants of an orgunit which you have already selected. As an example, if the user has been assigned to a disitrct, you should not (and not need to) select the facilities within that district.</para>
            <para>Note that data view organisation units are
            optional. If you do not specify any, the user will have access to the full organisation
            unit hierarchy for viewing aggregated data. As with the data capture organisation units, <emphasis>you should not select descendant organisation units of a unit which you have already selected</emphasis>. </para>
          </important>
          <para>In several places in the analysis modules one can select &quot;user organisation unit&quot;
            for the organisation unit dimension. This mechanism will first attempt to use the data
            view organisation units linked to the current user. If not found, it will use the data
            capture organisation units. If the user has been assigned to multiple organisation units, the use of &quot;user organisation unit&quot; may result in unpredictable behavior.</para>

          by selecting dimensions that will restrict the users view. For example, let&apos;s say you have defined <emphasis role="italic">Implementing Partner</emphasis>
          as a category option group set, and you have shared with this user only one or more specific implementing partners
          (category option groups.) If you want to insure that the user does not see totals in analytics that include values
          from other groups, assign <emphasis role="italic">Implementing Partner</emphasis> to this user. This insures that any data visible to the user
          through DHIS2 analytics will be filtered to select only the Implementing Partner category option group(s) which
          are visible to the user.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Managed users</title>
      <para>DHIS 2 supports a concept for user management referred to as <emphasis role="italic">managed users</emphasis> which which allows to explicitly define which users should be
        allowed to manage or modify which users. To &quot;manage a user&quot; implies that you can see and
        modify that user. The basic concept for user management is that you can see and modify users
        which you have been granted all of the authorities; in other words you can modify users
        which have a subset of your own authorities. The managed users concept gives you greater
        control over this.</para>
      <para>The managed users concept allows you to define which users should be able to manage
        which users. This is configured through user groups and memberships within such groups. A
        user group can be configured to be allowed to manage other user groups from the standard add
        and update user interface. The effect is that a specific user can manage all users which are
        members of user groups which can be managed by a user group that the user is member of. In
        other words, users can be managed by all members of user groups which are managing user
        groups they are member of.</para>
      <para>To enable this concept you should grant users the authority to &quot;Add/update users within
        managed groups&quot;, and <emphasis role="italic">not</emphasis> grant access to the standard
        &quot;Add/update users&quot; authority. An implication of the managed users concept is that when
        creating a user with the &quot;Add/update users within managed groups&quot; only, the user must be
        made a member of at least one user group that the current user can manage. If not, the
        current user would lose access to the user being created immediately. This is validated by
        the system.</para>
      <para>When granted the &quot;Add/update users within managed groups&quot; authority, the
        system lets a user add members to user groups for which she has read-only access to. The
        purpose of this is to allow for decentralized user management. You may define a range of
        user groups where other users may add or remove members, but not remove or change the name
        of the group.</para>

    <section>
      <title>OpenID Support</title>
      <para>DHIS 2 supports the OpenID standard, which allows third party login using a OpenID
        provider, please see <link xl:href="http://openid.net">http://openid.net</link> for more
        information. To create a custom OpenID URL for a username you can visit this URL and log in
        with your OpenID provider: <link xl:href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com">http://openid-provider.appspot.com</link>.</para>
      <para>To enable support for this in DHIS 2, two steps must be done:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Set your OpenID provider</emphasis>: This can be done inside
              system settings, under &quot;Access&quot;. Here you can set both the OpenID provider, and also
              the label to display on the login page to login with this provider (defaults to Login
              with OpenID).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Set the OpenID identifier on the user</emphasis>: For every
              user that should be able to login with his OpenID identifier, you will need to set
              this on the user itself. This can be done in user management, under the email field,
              there is not a field called <emphasis role="italic">OpenID</emphasis> which can be
              used to fill in the OpenID identifier. </para>
