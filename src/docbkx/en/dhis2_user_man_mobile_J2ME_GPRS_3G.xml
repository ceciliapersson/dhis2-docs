  <title>J2ME GPRS/3G Client</title>
  <para>The DHIS2 GPRS/3G mobile module provides a mechanism for remote clients using mobile phones to enter data directly into the DHIS2 system. There are two functions of the client, namely:</para>
  <para>The solution relies on the mobile phone having a data connection available (i.e.
    GPRS, Edge, 3G), over which it communicates with a DHIS2 instance which must be publicly
    available on the internet, as any other web server. The client application on the phone downloads the data entry forms to the phone from the
    server, and the forms can therefore be updated without installing a new application. This is also a crucial feature 
    for community reporting, which relies on regularly downloading activity plans from the server.

    <title>Data connection availability</title>
    <para>Data connection availability can be a problem in many of the contexts where DHIS2 mobile
      reporting would otherwise be a good solution for getting data directly into DHIS2. If that is
      the case for you, you might want to consider trying the SMS based solution described in a
      separate document. Keep in mind that even though a data connection is currently required for
      communication between the server and the mobile phone, it is only required when initializing
      or updating the mobile application and when sending reports to the server. The phone stores
      all entered data locally, so it can work fine with only temporary access to a data connection
      on a regular basis. </para>

      <para>By default, a data set is mapped to a single form on the phone. If the data set is
        divided into sections, each section is displayed as a separate page on the phone. If a data

      <title>Sorting of forms</title>
      <para>By default, data elements will be sorted according to the global sorting assigned in DHIS2. If sections are used, their section specific sorting order  will be used.
      In some cases, when sections are not used, a data element might be used in multiple data sets, and conflict in the way it should be sorted in individual data sets. A work around for this situation is to wrap the whole dataset in one section (note that this will only work if the data elements have the same category option combo)</para>

      <title>Versioning of data sets</title>

        <para>Initialization should be performed before the phones are delivered end-users.  Given the large variation in possible phone configurations, it is impossible to describe the exact steps which are required in order to enable the client on the phone. However, for most phones, simply copying the DHIS Web Mobile client &quot;JAR&quot; file to the phone with a USB cable or via Bluetooth is sufficient. Of course, GPRS/3G connectivity must be enabled. Contact your mobile service provider for exact details on the configuration of the phones and networks. </para>
