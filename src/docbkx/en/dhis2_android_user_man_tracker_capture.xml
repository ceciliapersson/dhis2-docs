  <title>Android Tracker Capture App</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The Tracker Capture Android app allows you capture, modify and list tracked entity instances with its enrollments and events. The Tracker
      Capture app works with multiple event-based programs in DHIS 2, which handles events
      linked to registered entities. These programs are suitable for handling
      disease programmes where multiple visits is required. The Tracker Capture app can be used for disease programmes such as tubercolosis and malaria.
      However the app is not tied to any specific domain and can potentially be utilized for any scenario of multiple event-based
      information.</para>
    <para>The Tracker Capture app allows you to capture events offline, i.e. without Internet
      connectivity. The app will automatically synchronize events with the online DHIS 2 server
      automatically when connectivity is present. This makes the app suitable for environments where
      Internet connectivity is scarce or unstable.</para>

    <title>Viewing Enrollments</title>
    <para>The main screen will show an overview of enrollments, as well as links to creating new ones.
      After the first login, there will be <emphasis role="italic">no</emphasis> enrollments showing up in the list. 
      Start by selecting organisation unit and program from the selectors at the upper part of the
      screen. For downloading existing tracker data from the server on to your device, press the middle button.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis role="italic">+</emphasis> button below the selectors will take you to the
      new enrollment screen. Below this button, all enrollments which have been registered for the selected
      organisation unit and program will be listed. Each column is configurable, and could show
      various types of information from each enrollment. The column to the far right shows the
      synchronization status. <emphasis role="italic">Sent</emphasis> means that the enrollment has been
      uploaded to the server, whereas <emphasis role="italic">Offline</emphasis> means that the
      enrollment is so far only stored at your device. Locally stored data will be synchronized automatically once an
      Internet connection is present. You can swipe down on the screen in order to trigger a
      synchronization attempt.</para>

    <para>The back button in the top top-left corner will take you back to the main screen (list of
      enrollments). The save button in the top-right corner will automatically save what you have entered for the
      enrollment so far.</para>  
    <para>The first form field contains a date selector and indicators the time of when the enrollment
      took place. If your program is selected to accept incident date, this will also be displayed.
      The labels is customizable and will vary from system to system.</para> 
    <para>The enrollment data entry form itself will be rendered below. The type of input field selector will
      depend on the type of the data element representing the input field. For example, you will see
      date selectors, free text input and numeric input fields. Data elements with predefined
      options will be rendered using a special dialog where you can either click directly on options
      or use a text input field to search for a specific option (useful if there is a high number of
      options).</para>

    <title>Downloading tracker data from the online DHIS 2 instance</title>
    <para> From the main screen press the middle button for querying the server. Since this task requires an Internet connection, please make sure that you have one. This task will query the server with the organisation unit and programme that you have selected from the main screen. After you have pressed this button a dialog appears. In this dialog you can either specify your search by pressing the <emphasis role="italic">detailed search</emphasis> button. The detailed search queries the server for tracked entity instances that contains the values that you have specified in your query. When you are finished with your query, press the globe for displaying the results from the server. If you want to display all tracked entity instances from the selected organisation unit and programme, you can simply press the globe button without entering any details. Depending on your Internet connection, this task can take some time so please be patient. A new dialog will present a list of results from your query containing tracked entity instances. Select the tracked entity instances that you want to download by tapping on them (A green tick on the right side will indicate that you have selected the tracked entity instance). After you have selected all your tracked entity instances that you want to download, press the download button, that has an icon with a downwards arrow, at the top of the dialog screen. The tracked entity instances will be downloaded in the background and the synchronization wheel will be displayed. When a tracked entity instance is finished downloading it will appear in the list at the bottom of the main screen.</para>
