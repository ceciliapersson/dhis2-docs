  <title>User management</title>
  <para>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a define set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</para>
