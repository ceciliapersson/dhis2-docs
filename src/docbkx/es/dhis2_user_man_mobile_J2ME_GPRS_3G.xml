  <title>J2ME GPRS/3G Client</title>
  <para>The DHIS2 GPRS/3G mobile module provides a mechanism for remote clients using mobile phones to enter data directly into the DHIS2 system. There are two functions of the client, namely:</para>
  <para>The solution relies on the mobile phone having a data connection available (i.e.
    GPRS, Edge, 3G), over which it communicates with a DHIS2 instance which must be publicly
    available on the internet, as any other web server. The client application on the phone downloads the data entry forms to the phone from the
    server, and the forms can therefore be updated without installing a new application. This is also a crucial feature 
    for community reporting, which relies on regularly downloading activity plans from the server.

    <title>Data connection availability</title>
    <para>Data connection availability can be a problem in many of the contexts where DHIS2 mobile
      reporting would otherwise be a good solution for getting data directly into DHIS2. If that is
      the case for you, you might want to consider trying the SMS based solution described in a separate document.
      Keep in mind that even though a data connection is currently required for communication between
      the server and the mobile phone, it is only required when initializing or updating the mobile
      application and when sending reports to the server. The phone stores all entered data locally,
      so it it can work fine with only temporary access to a data connection on a regular basis.

    <title>J2ME GPRS 3G facility reporting client</title>
    <para>The server side component of the web based solution  is included in the general build of DHIS2.</para>
    <para>In order to configure the DHIS2 web-based mobile reporting, you should follow the following steps. </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Set the &quot;Available for Mobile Reporting&quot; flag for the data sets you want reported:
          Under <emphasis>Maintenance-&gt;DataSet</emphasis>-&gt;<emphasis role="italic">Edit</emphasis> mark the “Available for Mobile Reporting” check box and save.

        <para>Create a user role for the mobile user. Select <emphasis role="italic">Maintenance-&gt;Users-&gt;User Role-&gt;Add new</emphasis>.  Add a user role name and description.

Fill in all of the required details, keeping in mind that the password must be at least 8 digits long, contain one capital letter,and one digit.

    <para>Like facility reporting module, sever side of activity reporting included in DHIS2 war file.</para>
    <para>Basically, server side setup for activity does not require any additional step. The mobile application use the same user name and password as  the web-based application. Make sure that the user is assigned to the correct organization unit.</para>
    <para>In short, if a user is able to enter data for activity reporting in DHIS2 web-based application, he/she is able to download and enter data in mobile application.</para>

    <title>Detailed configuration of data sets and reporting forms</title>
    <para>Though the previous steps is all that should be needed for testing the solution more detail configuration of the datasets may be required and are described in the following sections. </para>

      <title>The mapping of data sets to form layout on the phone</title>
      <para>By default, a data set is mapped to a single  form on the phone.
        If the data set is divided into sections, each section is displayed as a seperate page on the phone.
        If a data element has more than one category option combo it will be displayed as a heading with the category combination options

      <title>Sorting of forms</title>
      <para>By default, data elements will be sorted according to the global sorting assigned in DHIS2. If sections are used, their section specific sorting order  will be used.
      In some cases, when sections are not used, a data element might be used in multiple data sets, and conflict in the way it should be sorted in individual data sets. A work around for this situation is to wrap the whole dataset in one section (note that this will only work if the data elements have the same category option combo)</para>

      <title>Versioning of data sets</title>
      <para>To make it possible to compare and update the data sets on the mobile phone with the 
        version on the server, data sets are automatically versioned when you edit the data set structure. Some changes which occur on the DHIS2 server, will cause the mobile client to update its forms with a new version. </para>

        <para>Initialization should be performed before the phones are delivered end-users.  Given the large variation in possible phone configurations, it is impossible to describe the exact steps which are required in order to enable the client on the phone. However, for most phones, simply copying the DHIS Web Mobile client &quot;JAR&quot; file to the phone with a USB cable or via Bluetooth is sufficient. Of course, GPRS/3G connectivity must be enabled. Contact your mobile service provider for exact details on the configuration of the phones and networks. </para>
