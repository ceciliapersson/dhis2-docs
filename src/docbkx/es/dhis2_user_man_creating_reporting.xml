      <title>Types of data and aggregation</title>
      <para>In the bigger picture of HIS terminology all data in DHIS are usually called aggregated as they are aggregates (e.g. monthly summaries) of medical records or some kind of service registers reported from the health facilities. Aggregation inside DHIS however, which is the topic here, is concerned with how the raw data captured in DHIS (through data entry or import)are further aggregated over time (e.g. from monthly to quarterly values) or up the organisational hierarchy (e.g. from facility to district values).

        <title>Terminology</title>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Raw data</emphasis> refers to data that is registered into the DHIS 2 either through data entry or data import, and has not been manipulated by the DHIS aggregation process. All these data are stored in the table (or Java object if you prefer) called DataValue.
 </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Aggregated data</emphasis> refers to data that has been aggregated by the DHIS 2, meaning it is no longer raw data, but some kind of aggregate of the raw data.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Indicator values</emphasis> can also be understood as aggregated data, but these are special in the way that they are calculated based on user defined formulas (factor * numerator/denominator). Indicator values are therefore processed data and not raw data, and are located in the aggregatedindicatorvalue table/object. Indicators are calculated at any level of the organisational hierarchy and these calculations are then based on the aggregated data values available at each level. A level attribute in the aggregateddatavalue table refers to the organisational level of the orgunit the value has been calculated for.
    </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
    <emphasis>Period and Period type</emphasis> are used to specify the time dimension of the raw or aggregated values, and data can be aggregated from one period type to another, e.g from monthly to quarterly, or daily to monthly. Each data value has one period and that period has one period type. E.g data values for the periods Jan, Feb, and Mar 2009, all of the monthly period type can be aggregated together to an aggregated data value with the period Q1 2009 and period type Quarterly.

        <title>Basic rules of aggregation</title>
        <section>
          <title>What is added together</title>
          <para>Data (raw) can be registered at any organisational level, e.g. at at national hospital at level 2, a health facility at level 5, or at a bigger PHC at level 4. This varies form country to country, but DHIS is flexible in allowing data entry or data import to take place at any level. This means that orgunits that themselves have children can register data, sometimes the same data elements as their children units. The basic rule of aggregation in DHIS 2 is that <emphasis>all raw data is aggregated together</emphasis>, meaning data registered at a facility on level 5 is added to the data registered for a PHC at level 4.</para>
          <para>
It is up to the user/system administrator/designer to make sure that no duplication of data entry is taking place and that e.g. data entered at level 4 are not about the same services/visits that are reported by orgunit children at level 5. NOTE that in some cases you want to have duplication of data in the system, but in a controlled manner. E.g. when you have two different sources of data for population estimates, both level 5 catchment population data and another population data source for level 4 based on census data (because sum of level 5 catchments is not always the same as level 4 census data). Then you can specify using advanced aggregation settings (see further down) that the system should e.g. not add level 5 population data to the level 4 population data, and that level 3,2,1 population data aggregates are only based on level 4 data and does not include level 5 data.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>How data gets added together</title>
          <para>How data is aggregated depends on the dimension of aggregation (see further down).</para>
          <para>Along the orgunit level dimension data is always summed up, simply added together. Note that raw data is never percentages, and therefore can be summed together. Indicator values that can be percentages are treated differently (re-calculated at each level, never summed up).</para>
          <para>
Along the time dimension there are several possibilities, the two most common ways to aggregate are sum and average. The user can specify for each data element which method to use by setting the aggregation operator (see further down). Monthly service data are normally summed together over time, e.g. the number of vaccines given in a year is the sum of the vaccines given for each month of that year. For population, equipment, staff and other kind of what is often called semi-permanent data the average method is often the one to use, as, e.g. &apos;number of nurses&apos; working at a facility in a year would not be the sum of the two numbers reported in the six-monthly staffing report, but rather the average of the two numbers. More details further down under &apos;aggregation operators&apos;.

        <title>Dimensions of aggregation</title>
        <section>
          <title>Organisational units and levels</title>
          <para>Organisational units are used to represent the &apos;where&apos; dimension associated with data values. In DHIS 2, organisational units are arranged in a hierarchy, which typically corresponds to the hierarchical nature of the organisation or country. Organisational unit levels correspond to the distinct levels within the hierarchy. For instance, a country may be organized into provinces, then districts, then facilities, and then sub-centers. This organisational hierarchy would have five levels. Within each level, a number of organisational units would exist. During the aggregation process, data is aggregated from the lower organisational unit levels to higher levels. Depending on the aggregation operator, data may be &apos;summed&apos; or &apos;averaged&apos; within a given organisational unit level, to derive the aggregate total for all the organisational units that are contained within a higher level organisational unit level. For instance, if there are ten districts contained in a province and the aggregation operator for a given data element has been defined as &apos;SUM&apos;,  the aggregate total for the province would be calculated as the sum of the values of the individual ten districts contained in that province.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Period</title>
          <para>Periods are used to represent the &apos;when&apos; dimension associated with data values. Data can easily be aggregated from weeks to months, from months to quarters, and from quarters to years. DHIS 2 uses known rules of how these different intervals are contained within other intervals (for instance Quarter 1 2010 is known to contain January 2010, February 2010 an March 2010) in order to aggregate data from smaller time intervals, e.g. weeks, into longer time intervals, e.g. months. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Data Elements and Categories</title>
          <para>The data element dimension specifies &apos;what&apos; is being recorded by a particular data value. Data element categories are actually degenerated dimensions of the data element dimension, and are used to disaggregate the data element dimension into finer categories. Data element categories, such as &apos;Age&apos; and &apos;Gender&apos;, are used to record a particular data element, typically for different population groups. These categories can then be used to calculate the overall total for the category  and the total of all categories. </para>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Aggregation operators, methods for aggregation</title>
        <section>
          <title>Sum</title>
          <para>The &apos;sum&apos; operator simply calculates the sum of all data values that are contained within a particular aggregation matrix. For instance, if data is recorded on a monthly basis at the district level and is aggregated to provincial quarterly totals, all data contained in all districts for a given province and all weeks for the given quarter will be added together to obtain the aggregate total.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Average</title>
          <para>When the average aggregation operator is selected, the unweighted average of all data values within a given aggregation matrix are calculated. </para>
          <para>It is important to understand how DHIS 2 treats null values in the context of the average operator. It is fairly common for some organisational units not to submit data for certain data elements. In the context of the average operator, the average results from the number of data elemements that are actually present (therefore NOT NULL) within a given aggregation matrix. If there are 12 districts within a given province, but only 10 of these have submitted data, the average aggreate will result from these ten values that are actually present in the database, and will not take into account the missing values.  </para>

        <title>Advanced aggregation settings (aggregation levels)</title>
        <section>
          <title>Aggregation levels</title>
          <para>The normal rule of the system is to aggregate all raw data together when moving up the organisational hierarchy, and the system assumes that data entry is not being duplicated by entering the same services provided to the same clients at both facility level and also entering an &apos;aggregated&apos; (sum of all facilities) number at a higher level. This is to more easily facilitate aggregation when the same services are provided but to different clients/catchment populations at facilities on level 5 and a PHC (the parent of the same facilities) at level 4. In this way a facility at level 5 and a PHC at level 4 can share the same data elements and simply add together their numbers to provide the total of services provided in the geographical area.</para>
          <para>Sometimes such an aggregation is not desired, simply because it would mean duplicating data about the same population. This is the case when you have two different sources of data for two different orgunit levels. E.g. catchment population for facilities can come from a different source than district populations and therefore the sum of the facility catchment populations do not match the district population provided by e.g. census data. If this is the case we would actually want duplicated data in the system so that each level can have as accurate numbers as possible, but then we do NOT want to aggregate these data sources together.
</para>
          <para>In the Data Element section you can edit data elements and for each of them specify how aggregation is done for each level. In the case described above we need to tell the system NOT to include facility data on population in any of the aggregations above that level, as the level above, in this case the districts have registered their population directly as raw data. The district population data should then be used at all levels above and including the district level, while facility level should use its own data.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>How to edit data element aggregation</title>
          <para>This is controlled through something called aggregation levels and at the end of the edit data element screen there is a tick-box called Aggregation Levels. If you tick that one you will see a list of aggregation levels, available and selected. Default is to have no aggregation levels defined, then all raw data in the hierarchy will be added together. To specify the rule described above, and given a hierarchy of Country, Province, District, Facility: select Facility and District as your aggregation levels. Basically you select where you have data. Selecting Facility means that Facilities will use data from facilities (given since this is the lowest level). Selecting District means that the District level raw data will be used when aggregating data for District level (hence no aggregation will take place at that level), and the facility data will not be part of the aggregated District values. When aggregating data at Province level the District level raw data will be used since this is the highest available aggregation level selected. Also for Country level aggregates the District raw data will be used. Just to repeat, if we had not specified that District level was an aggregation level, then the facility data and district data would have been added together and caused duplicate (double) population data for districts and all levels above.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Data mart</title>
      <para>The purpose of the data mart is to provide pre-processed data to external data analysis and reporting tools. The data mart consists of two tables, aggregateddatavalues and aggregatedindicatorvalues in the DHIS 2 database. The values in the data mart are aggregated versions of the raw data found in the datavalue table as well as calculated indicator values. Aggregation can take place over time (e.g. from monthly data to aggregated quarterly values), or along the organisation unit hierarchy levels (e.g. from PHU data to aggregated district totals). The data mart can store all kinds of such aggregated values. The data mart is as such just a processed &apos;copy&apos; of the data values and it can be emptied and regenerated at any time, and the tables are read only tables. The metadata in the two data mart tables are referenced by internal identifiers, such as dataelementid, organisationunitid which refer to the tables like dataelement and organisationunit, see &apos;How to make use of the data mart in external tools&apos; for more on this. </para>
      <section>
        <title>The data mart export process</title>
        <para>The DHIS2 Data Mart handles the aggregation of data across multiple dimensions (organisation unit hierarchy, orgunit group hierarchy, time, etc) and can be controlled through this interface. Select the organisation unit levels which should be aggregated, the start date and end date, and press &quot;Start export&quot;. The data mart process will be executed in the background, and a full report of the export process will be updated regularly so that you can determine the state of the process. See the section on &quot;Scheduling&quot; in the data administration module for information on how this process can be triggered to run automatically.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Data element categories in the data mart</title>
          <para>Each data value for a data element has a reference to a category option combo, which is a combination of the disaggregations for the data value, e.g. (male,&lt;5y) or (In PHU, &lt;1y). These disaggregations are exported as they are to the data mart, and no aggregation is done on this dimension. See the data elements section for more on data element categories and the resource tables section for more information on how to do aggregation on these categories.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Adding new data to an existing data mart</title>
          <para>When you add new data to an existing data mart the new values will be appended to the existing so that the data mart grows for each new process if new selections (such as new periods) have been made. If any of the selected values are already in the data mart, then the old will be replaced by the newly generated values. </para>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Resource tables</title>
      <para>Resource tables provide additional information about the dimensions of the data in a format that is well suited for external tools to combine with the data mart tables. By joining the data mart with these resource tables one can easily aggregate along the data element category dimension or data element/indicator/organisation unit groups dimensions. E.g. by tagging all the data values with the category option male or female and provide this in a separate column &apos;gender&apos; one can get subtotals of male and female based on data values that are collected for category option combinations like (male, &lt;5) and (male,&gt;5). See the Pivot Tables section for more examples of how these can be used.

orgunitstructure is another important table in the database that helps to provide the hierarchy of orgunits together with the data. By joining the orgunitstructure table with the data mart tables you can get rows of data values with the full hierarchy, e.g. on the form:
OU1, OU2, OU3, OU4, DataElement, Period, Value
(Sierra Leone, Bo, Badija, Ngelehun CHC, BCG &lt;1, Jan-10, 32)

This format makes it much easier for e.g. pivot tables or other OLAP tools to aggregate data up the hierarchy.

    <section xml:id="reportTable">
      <title>Report tables</title>
      <para>Report tables are defined, cross-tabulated reports which can be used as the basis of further reports, such as Excel Pivot Tables or simply downloaded as an Excel sheet. Report tables are intended to provide a specific view of data which is required, such as &quot;Monthly National ANC Indicators&quot;. This report table might provide all ANC indicators for a country, aggregated by month for the entire country.  This data could of course be retrieved from the main datamart, but report tables generally perform faster and present well defined views of data to users. </para>
      <important>
        <para> It is therefore important to keep in mind that when the aggregation strategy of the system is set to &quot;Batch&quot;, the data for each report table must also be present in the data mart. </para>

    <title>How to create report tables</title>
    <para>To create a new report table, go to the Report tables section of the Reports module (Reports -&gt; Report Table). Above the list of standard reports, use the &quot;Add report table&quot; or &quot;Add Dataelement Dimension Table&quot; buttons. A regular report table can be used to hold data on data elements, indicators or dataset completeness, while Dataelement  dimension tables are used to include data element categories in report tables. Creating the tables are done in the same way, however, the only exception being when choosing data.</para>
    <para>To create a report table, you start by making some general choices for the table, the most important of which is the crosstab dimension. Then, you choose which data elements, indicators,  datasets or data element dimensions you want to include. Finally you select which organisation units and time periods to use in the report table. Each of these steps are described in detail below.</para>

      <para>There are two ways to select both what organisation units to include in a report, and what time periods should be included: relative, or fixed. Fixed organisation units and/or periods means that you select the units/periods to include in the report table when you create the report table. Using relative periods, you can select the time and/or units as parameters when the report table is populated, for example when running a standard report or creating a chart. A combination is also possible, for example to add some organisation units in the report permanently while letting the users choose additional. Report parameters is discussed below. In general, using fixed organisation units and/or time periods are an unnecessary restriction.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Fixed Organisation Units</emphasis></para>
      <para>To add fixed organisation units, click &quot;Toggle fixed organisation units&quot;. A panel will appear where  you can choose orgunits to always include in the report. If you leave it blank,  the users select orgunits when running the report through the use of  report parameters. Use the drop down menu to filter organisation units by level, double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Fixed Periods</emphasis></para>
      <para>To add fixed periods, click &quot;Toggle fixed organisation units&quot;. A panel will appear where  you can choose periods to always include in the report. If you leave it blank,  the users select periods when running the report through the use of  report parameters. Use the drop down menu to choose period type (week, month, etc), the Prev and Next button to choose year,  and double click or use the buttons to add/remove.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Relative periods</emphasis></para>
      <para>Instead of using fixed/static periods like &apos;Jan-2010&apos; or &apos;Q1-2010&apos;, more generic periods can be used to create reusable report tables, e.g. for monthly reports the period &apos;Reporting month&apos; will simply pick the current reporting month selected by the user when running the report. Note that all relative periods are relative to a &quot;reporting month&quot;. The reporting month is  either selected by the users, otherwise the current month is used. Here is a description of the possible relative periods:

      <para>Let&apos;s say we have chosen three indicators: A, B and C, and we have also chosen to use the relative periods &apos;Reporting month&apos; and &apos;This year&apos; when we created the report table. If the reporting month (selected automatically or by the user) is for example May 2010, the report table will calculate the values for the three selected indicators for May 2010 (= the &apos;Reporting month&apos;) and the accumulated values for the three selected indicators so far in 2010 (= so far &apos;This year&apos;).</para>
      <para>Thus, we will end up with six values for each of the organisation units: &quot;Indicator A May 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator B May 2010&quot; &quot;Indicator C May 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator A so far in 2010&quot;, &quot;Indicator B so far in 2010&quot; and &quot;Indicator C so far in 2010&quot;.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Report parameters</emphasis></para>
      <para>Report parameters make the reports more generic and reusable over time and for different organisation units. These parameters will pop up when generating the report table or running a report based on the report table. The users will select what they want to see in the report. There are four possible report parameters, and you can select none, all, or any combination.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Example - report parameters</emphasis></para>
      <para>Continuing with the example on relative periods just above, let&apos;s say that in addition to &apos;Reporting month&apos;, we have chosen  &apos;Parent organisation unit&apos; as a report parameter when we created the report table. When we&apos;re running the report table, we will be asked to select an organisation unit. Now, let&apos;s say we choose &quot;Region R&quot; as the organisation unit. &quot;Region R&quot; has the children &quot;District X&quot; and &quot;District Y&quot;.</para>
      <para>When the report is run, the system will aggregate data for both &quot;District X&quot; and &quot;District Y&quot;. The data will be aggregated from the lowest level where they have been collected. The values for the districts will be aggregated further to give an aggregated value for &quot;Region R&quot;.</para>
      <para>Thus, the report table will generate the six values presented in the previous example, for &quot;District X&quot;, &quot;District Y&quot; and &quot;Region R&quot;.</para>

      <title>Data element dimension tables</title>
      <para>These tables enable the use of data element categories in report tables. There are two differences from regular report tables. The first is that it is not possible to select crosstab dimensions, as the columns will always be the disaggregations from the category combinations. The other is the actual choice of data. Only one category combination can be added per report, and only data elements from the same category combo can be selected. </para>
      <para>Subtotals and the total will also be included in the table, e.g. a gender (male, female) + EPI age(&lt;1, &gt;1) category combo would give the following columns:
male+&lt;1, male+&gt;1, Female+&lt;1, female+&gt;1, male, female,&lt;1, &gt;1, total.

      <title>Report table - best practices</title>
      <para>To make the report tables reusable over time and across orgunits they can have  parameters. Four types of parameters are allowed; orgunit, parent orgunit (for listing of orgunits in one area), grand parent orgunit and reporting month. As a side note it can be mentioned that we are looking into expanding this to include reporting quarter and year, or to make that period parameter more generic with regard to period type somehow. The ability to use period as a parameter makes the report table reusable over time and as such fits nicely with report needs such as monthly, quarterly or annual reports. When a report is run by the user in DHIS 2, the user must specify the values for the report tables that are linked to the report. First the report table is re-generated (deleted and re-created with updated data), and then the report is run (in the background, in Jasper report engine).

</para>
      <para>Report tables can consist of  values related to data elements, indicators or data completeness, which is related to completeness of reporting across orgunits for a given month. Completeness reports will be covered in a separate section.</para>
      <para>There are three dimensions in a report table that identify the data; indicators or data elements, orgunits and periods. For each of these dimensions the user can select which metadata values to include in the report. The user must select one or more data elements or indicators to appear in the report. The orgunit selection can be substituted with a parameter, either one specific orgunit or an orgunit parent (making itself and all its children appear in the report). If one or more orgunits are selected and no orgunit parameter is used, then the report is static with regard to which orgunits to include, which in most cases is an unnecessary restriction to a report.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Using relative periods</emphasis></para>
      <para>The period selection is more advanced as it can in addition to specific periods like Jan-09, Q1-08, 2007 also contain what is called relative periods. As report usually is run routinely over time a specific period like Jan-09 is not very useful in a report. Instead, if you want to design a monthly report, you should use the relative period called Reporting Month. Then you must also include Reporting Month as one of your report parameters to let the system know what exactly is the Reporting Month on the time of report generation. There are many other relative periods available, and they all relate to the report parameter Reporting Month. E.g. the relative period called So far this year refers to the accumulative value for the year incl. the Reporting Month. If you want a trend report with multiple periods in stead of one aggregated period, you can select e.g. &apos;Months this year&apos;, which would give you values for each month so far in the year. You can do a similar report with quarters. The idea is to support as many generic report types as possible using relative periods, so if you have other report needs, please suggest new relative periods on the mailing list, and they might be added to the report table options.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Cross-tabbing dimensions</emphasis></para>
      <para>Cross tabbing is a very powerful functionality in report design, as the typical DHIS 2 data table with references to period, data element/indicator and orgunit makes more advanced report design very difficult, as you cannot put e.g. specific indicators, periods or orgunits on specific columns. E.g. by cross-tabbing on the indicator dimension in an indicator report table you will get the indicator names on the column headers in your report, in addition to a column referencing orgunit, and another column referencing period. With such a table design you could drag and drop indicator names to specific columns or chart positions in the iReport software. Similarly you can cross tab on orgunits or periods to make their names specifically available to report design. E.g. by cross-tabbing on periods and selecting the two relative periods &apos;Reporting month&apos; and &apos;This year&apos;, you can design reports with both the last month and the accumulative annual value for given month as they will be available as column headers in your report table. It is also possible to combine two dimensions in cross-tabbing, e.g. period and indicator, which makes it possible to e.g. look at three selected indicators for two specific relative periods. This would e.g. make it possible to make a table or chart based report with BCG, DPT3 and Measles coverage, both for the last month and the accumulative coverage so far in the year. 

</para>
      <para>All in all, by combining the functionality of cross tabbing, relative periods and report table parameters you should have a tool to support most report scenarios. If not, we would be very happy to receive suggestions to further improvements to report tables. As already mentioned, we have started to look at more fine-grained parameters for the period dimension as the &apos;Reporting month&apos; does not cover enough, or at least is not intuitive enough, when it comes to e.g. quarterly reports.

    <title>Report table outcome</title>
    <para>
When the report table is run, the system will calculate values for specified indicators/data elements/data sets, orgunits and periods. The data will be presented in DHIS 2 in a table layout. The column headers will correspond to the cross-tab dimension you have selected. An example report table showing ANC coverage for a district in The Gambia, is shown below. Here the indicator and the periods are cross-tabbed, as can be seen from the column headers.

      <para>A standard report is a manually designed report that presents manually chosen data in a manually specified layout. Still, it&apos;s highly flexible, as it can be designed to be reused over and over again, by making use of the powerful report tables.</para>
      <para>A standard report can present any value from any table in the DHIS 2 database, but for the report design, we want the reports to be flexible, so we want to connect the reports to tables that changes through time. The report tables are therefore ideal for the report design.</para>

      <title>Designing Standard reports in iReport</title>
      <para>Jasper iReport Designer is a tool for creating reports that can be used as Standard Reports in DHIS 2. The tool allows for the creation of standard report templates that can easily be exported from DHIS 2 with up to date data. The process of creating reports involves four major steps:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>

          <para>The edited report can then be uploaded to DHIS 2 to be used as a standard report.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>If you want to preview your report during the design in iReport, you actually have to upload your file to DHIS 2 to see how it looks.</para>
      <para>These four steps will be describe in detail in the coming sections. In general, when you are making standard reports you should have a clear idea of how it should look before you even make the report table, as how the report table is designed has implications for how the report can be formatted in iReport. For example, what crosstab dimensions are selected in the report table has consequences for what crosstabs are available for the standard report, and it has consequences for what types of charts you can make.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Note: If you have not created a report table yet, you have to do so. See section &quot;How to create report tables&quot; to do so.</emphasis></para>

      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Editing the report</title>
        <para>You are now ready to edit the layout of the report. The main iReport window consists of a &quot;Report Inspector&quot; to the left, the report document in the middle, a &quot;Palette&quot; area on the upper right hand side and a &quot;Properties&quot; area on the lower right hand side. The &quot;Report Inspector&quot; are used for selecting and examining the various properties of the report, and when selecting an item in the inspector, the &quot;Properties&quot; panel changes to display properties relating to the selection. The &quot;Palette&quot; is used for adding various elements, e.g. text boxes, images and charts to the document.

        <para>The iReport document is divided into seven main bands, divided by layout separators (the blue lines). These lines are used to decide how big each of the areas should be on the report. 
</para>
        <para>The areas all have different purposes:
</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Title - area for the title of the report</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Page header - area for the page header</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Column header - area for column headers (for the table)</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Detail 1 - area where the actual report data will be placed</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Column footer - area to make footer of the table</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Summary - elements in this area will be placed at the end of the report</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>By default you will see that only the Title, Column Header and the Detail 1 bands have data.
        For most reports this is OK. The Title band is suitable for a title and e.g. a chart. 
        Data fields entered into the Detail 1 area will be iterated over to create a table. 
        For example, if a field called &quot;datalementname&quot; is placed in the Detail 1 band,
        all data elements in the report table will be listed here. 
        We&apos;ll come back to data fields management just a little below.</para>
        <para>The unused bands in the report are shrinked to add more space for your report data. You can
        however increase/decrease the band height as you like. There are two ways to do that. The first way is simply to drag the blue band-line as shown below.</para>

        </screenshot>
        <para>The other way to adjust the band height is to select a band in the 
        &quot;Report Inspector&quot;, and then adjust the &quot;Band height&quot; value in the 
        &quot;Detail 1 - properties&quot; area in the lower right corner.</para>

        <para>As the fields are already present on the report, you probably don&apos;t want to do anything
        than just fix the layout and drag fields around. You can also resize the fields by dragging the side, top or bottom lines. If you want to change the text in the column headers, you simply double click the field and change the text.</para>
        <para>To add the a field to the table, we simply drag it to the Detail 1 band from the &quot;Report Inspector&quot;. The column header will be added automatically.</para>

          <para>Text fields can represent either numbers or text, so that they can be used both for showing for example names of district or for numeric values. It is therefore important the the Expression class, seen in the Text field properties matches the Text field expression. For the default text fields in the .jrxml file downloaded from DHIS 2 this is not a problem, but it is important when making new text fields. The two most important Expression classes are java.lang.Double for numbers and java.lang.String for text.</para>

            <para>For example, let us say you have a quarterly report where you would like to add a new column with the yearly total. You therefore add a new Static text field to the column header band, and a Text field to the details band in. By default, new Text fields are set to java.lang.String (text). However, the yearly total column will be filled with numbers. We therefore have to change the Expression class for the new text field to java.lang.Double:</para>

        <title>Filtering the table rows</title>
        <para>In the default table exported from DHIS 2, there are some rows that it might be better to leave out of the table, and some that it would be preferable to have at the end. For example, when making a table based on a report table with the «parent organisation unit» parameter, the default table might have a row with the national level somewhere in between all the regions. In iReport, this can be changed so that the «parent organisation unit» appears at the bottom of the table. This involves two steps that will be explained below. Note that this will not work where there is only one organisation units, and it is therefore most useful when using the «parent organisation unit» or «grand parent organisation unit» parameters in the report table.</para>
        <section>
          <title>Hiding the «parameter organisation unit» from the table</title>
          <para>We exclude the &quot;paramter organisation unit&quot; from the table by using a property in the Details band called &quot;Print when expression&quot;. To set a Print when expression, start by selecting the Detail band in the Report inspector, then edit the Print when expression in the properties panel.</para>

          <para>The Expression editor window should now appear. What we must do is to create an expression that checks if the row being generated is the row with the organisation unit given as a parameter. The report table contains a column that we can use for this called organisation_unit_is_parent. To exclude the row with the parameter organisation unit, double click on organisation_unit_is_parent in the list to copy it to the expression area, then add <command>.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command> at the end so that the code is:</para>
          <para><command>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command></para>
          <para>This tells the report engine to only print table rows where the organisation unit is not the parent organisation unit.</para>

          <title>Putting the &quot;param organisation unit&quot; at the bottom of the table</title>
          <para>Instead of removing the &quot;param organisation unit&quot; from the table entirely, it is also possible to put it at the bottom (or top) of the table. This is done by using the sort functionality explained in the next section, and choosing to sort first by &quot;organisation_unit_is_parent&quot;. Other sorting options can be added in addition to this, for example to make a list where the param organisation unit is at the bottom of the table, with the other organisation units listed alphabetically above it.
          </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Hiding other rows</title>
          <para>Using the expression editor it is also possible to exclude other rows from the table, in addition to the parent organisation unit as was explained above. In Ghana, for example, all regions have a «fake district» which is the name of the region in square brackets. This can also be excluded from the table using the Print when expression that was introduced above. To to this, follow the instructions above to bring up the Expression editor window. Then, we use Java expressions to test whether or not the row should be hidden.</para>
          <section>
            <title>Example - removing rows with organisation units starting with [</title>
            <para>Example - removing rows with organisation units starting with [</para>
            <para><command>($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != &apos;[&apos;)</command></para>
            <para>This makes the report skip any rows where the first character of the organisation unit name is [.</para>
            <para>It is also possible to combine several of these expressions. To do this we put the expressions in a parenthesis with the two characters &amp;&amp; in between. For example, to make a table that leaves both organisation units whose name starts with [ and the parent organisation unit, we can use the following expression:</para>
            <para><command>($F{organisationunitname}.charAt( 0 ) != &apos;[&apos;)&amp;&amp;$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals(&quot;No&quot;)</command></para>

In some cases these are not always very meaningful for third parties, but with some work they can be given custom names through iReport. This is useful for example if you are making a report with indicators as rows and periods as column, or for charts with indicators. </para>

        <para>Right click the text field and choose &quot;Edit Expression&quot;. This will bring up the &quot;Expressions editor&quot;.  As the expression, we want to sum up all the columns. In this case we have three value expressions we want to sum up: &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October 2010&quot;, &quot;November 2010&quot;. The name of these fields will vary depending on the crosstab dimension you have chosen in the report table. In our case, the  expression we make is  &quot;$f{September}+$f{October 2010}+$f{November 2010}&quot;:</para>

        <title>Groups of tables</title>
        <para>There are cases when it can be useful to have several tables in one report. This can be done using Report groups. Using this functionality, one can for example create a report one table for each indicator, or one table of each organisation unit. In the following, we will go through the steps needed to make a report with three indicators, each represented in one table. It is important that the report table does not crosstab on indicators when we want to make groups of tables based on indicators. </para>
        <para>In our example, the .jrxml file downloaded from DHIS 2 will by default have one column for organisation unit and on for indicators (assuming we have chosen periods as the only crosstab dimension). We start by removing the indicator column, since this in not needed in our case, and realign the other fields to fit the report.</para>

          <title>Sorting and grouping</title>
          <para>When using grouping, some precautions must be taken with regards to sorting. Notably, when adding sorting parameters, whatever parameter is used as basis for the grouping must come first. Thus if you are grouping the report by indicator, and want sort the organisation units alphabetically, you have to choose to sort first by indicator, then by organisation unit name as shown below. For instructions on how to add sorting, see the sorting section above.</para>

        <para>By default, a 3D bar chart is included in the .jrxml file that is downloaded from DHIS 2. This is set up so that only data from the «parameter orgnisation unit» (often the parent or grand parent) is used. Usually, this is a good solution. Since it is the default, we will start by looking at bar charts, before looking at line charts.</para>

If for some reason you do not want this, simply delete the text in the text box. In this case we do NOT want the filter, as we are making a chart showing a comparison across districts. To continue, click the details tab.</para>

          <para>However, if you want to have the name of each bar along the x-axis of the chart instead of using the legend, this can be done by adding whatever text you want to present in the Category expression field, or by inserting an expression to have it filled automatically when the report is run. In this case, we want to have one bar for each organisation unit. We therefore edit the category expression by clicking on the button to the right.</para>

          <title>Line charts</title>
          <para>Line charts can be useful in many circumstances. However, to make line charts the report data (report table) must be suited for it. Thus if you want to make a line chart, it is important that the report table does not have periods in the crosstab dimension. Examples where this is useful is if you are making a report for a single organisation unit with one or more indicators, or if you are making a report with one indicator and one or more organisation units.</para>
          <para>Below, we will go though the steps needed to make a report with a line chart showing the development of three indicators over one year, for one organisation unit. We start by making a report table with the choices shown below:</para>

          <para>Next, adjust the size and position of the chart in your report. Then, we will add one data series for each of our three indicators. Right-click on the chart and choose Chart data. If you are making a chart with one indicator and several organisation units, you probably want to make a filter expression so that only data from the paramter/parent organisation unit is used in the chart. To do this, add this line to the Filter expression area:</para>
          <para><command>$F{organisation_unit_is_parent}.equals(&quot;Yes&quot;)</command></para>
          <para>In our example, we only have on organisation unit, so this is not necessary. Next, click the details tab to see a list of the series in the chart. For now, this list is empty, but we will add one series for each of our three indicators. To add a series, click the Add button.</para>

However, some additional adjustments might be needed - most of these can be found in the Line chart properties panel. For example, when making a month by month chart as we have in example, there is often not enough space for the month names along the category axis. This can be fixed by rotating the labels by for example -40 degrees, by using the property Category Axis Tick Label Rotation.</para>

        <title>Adding the Report to DHIS 2</title>
        <para>We can now switch to DHIS 2 and import our report. Go to the Report Module in DHIS 2, and select &quot;Standard Report&quot;. In the &quot;Standard Report&quot; screen, click &quot;Add new&quot;, or edit an existing one.</para>
        <para>In the following screen, there are several actions we need to take. First, enter a name for the new &quot;Standard Report&quot;. Second, for design, click &quot;Choose File&quot; and find the .jrxml-file you have edited in iReport. Then we select the report table that we used as a basis for the report in iReport. Click add, and it should move to the &quot;Selected report tables&quot; area. Finally, click save.

        <title>Some final guidelines</title>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Use the same version of iReport and DHIS 2&apos;s version of Jasper reports. See the About page in DHIS 2 for the Jasper version in use.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Use report tables with cross tab dimensions  as your data source for your report designs. This will make it a lot easier to design reports where you need to put specific indicators, periods, or orgunits on columns.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Learn from others, there are many DHIS 2 report designs for Jasper  on  launchpad, see http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~DHIS 2-devs-core/DHIS 2/trunk/files/head:/resources/</para>
