  <title>Data Administration</title>
  <para>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </para>
  <section xml:id="dataBrowser">
    <title>Data browser</title>
    <para>The data browser maintenance and analysis module which allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. The summary view provides a count of data elements which have been entered at the selected organisation unit as well as its descendants. Raw data for all data elements for a range of time periods and a given organisational unit can be browsed and exported to Excel, CSV, or PDF formats. There are four modes of the data browser, which determine how the data is summarized</para>

  <section xml:id="dataIntegrity">
    <title>Data integrity</title>
    <para>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </para>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements without data set</title>
      <para>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the &quot;orphaned&quot; data element to the appropriate data set. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements without groups</title>
      <para>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the PivotSource recordsets that `feed` the pivot tables. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>
      Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the same data element group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that a data element can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> data element group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Data element groups to review each data element identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</title>
      <para>Data Elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data sets not assigned to organisation units</title>
      <para>All data sets should be assigned to at least one organisation unit. </para>

    <section>
      <title>Indicators with identical formulas</title>
      <para>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Indicators without groups</title>
      <para>All Data Elements and Indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` Indicators to its correct group.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Invalid indicator numerators</title>
      <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the numerator definition. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Invalid indicator denominators</title>
      <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the denominator definition. </para>

    <section>
      <title>Indicators violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>
      Some indicators have been allocated to several indicator groups that are members of the same indicator group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that an indicator can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> indicator group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Indicator groups to review each indicator identified in the integrity check. Either remove the indicator from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.

    <section>
      <title>Organisation units without groups</title>
      <para>All organisation units <emphasis>must</emphasis> be allocated to at least <emphasis>one</emphasis> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to  Maintenance -&gt; Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `OrgUnitType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</title>
      <para>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the `organisation unitType` group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one group. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Organisation units violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of the same organisation unit group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that an organisation unit can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the &apos;Hospital&apos; and &apos;Clinic&apos; groups , but rather to only to one of them. Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation unit from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title> Organisation unit groups without group sets</title>
      <para>The organisation unit groups listed here have not been allocated to a group set. Go to Maintenance-&gt;Organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and allocate the Organisation unit group to the appropriate group set. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Validation rules without groups</title>

  <section xml:id="dataArchive">
    <title>Data Archive</title>
    <para>The purpose of the data archive function is to move data which is currently not being used for analysis to a secondary storage location in order to improve performance of the application. Data can be both archived and unarchived. When archiving data one moves it from the primary storage to the secondary storage location, while unarchiving moves it from the secondary storage location to the primary. Analysis functionality in DHIS 2 heavily utilizes queries to the data value database table, and by reducing the size of this table these operations will be significantly faster. Typically one would want to archive data that is older than two years.</para>
    <para>To archive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be archived. Then press the archive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
    <para>To unarchive data, first enter a start date and an end date for the time span of the data which should be unarchived. Then press the unarchive button. The operation might take a few minutes.</para>
    <para>In some cases you might end up with overlapping data. For instance one might archive data for a given timespan, then later enter data for a period in that timespan. In such cases the system will automatically overwrite the oldest of the overlapping values with the newest during the archive or unarchive operation.</para>

  <section xml:id="optionSet">
    <title>Option sets</title>
    <para> Option sets can be associated with data elements in the add / update data element interface for name-based data elements. You can define any kind of options, for instance an option set
called &quot;Delivery type&quot; where &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Breach&quot;, &quot;Caesarian&quot; and
&quot;Assisted&quot; would be the options. This option set can later be

  <section xml:id="attribute">
    <title>Dynamic attributes</title>
    <para>Dynamic attributes can be used to add additional information to certain objects (namely data elements, indicators, organisation units and users). In addition to the standard attributes each of these objects have, it may be required in certain installations to have additional attributes, such as a fax number which is associated with an organisation unit. To add a new dynamic attribute to an object, select &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Data administration&quot; from the main menue, then &quot;Attribute&quot; from the left side panel, and press the &quot;Add new&quot; button.</para>

    <para>To create a new attribute, assign it a name. Each attribute should have a unique name. Check the tick-box &quot;Mandatory&quot; if the object should always have the dynamic attribute. Next, select which object (or objects) the attribute should be assigned to. Lastly, select the value type. You can choose from &quot;Text&quot;, &quot;Yes/No&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;Integer&quot;, &quot;Positive integer&quot; and &quot;Negative integer&quot;. If the value supplied for the attribute does not match the value type, an error will result. Finally, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the attribute. </para>
    <para>The dynamic attribute will now be present in the object which you assigned it to in the respective &quot;Edit&quot; screen of each the object.</para>
